# E707 Basic NodeMCU-V2 Shield Library 
## Rev 1.0

This library is for the E707 Basic NodeMCU-V2 Shield, which is a daughterboard to be used with the NodeMCU V2 board. 
This library provides pin definitions for the board (so `SHIELD_SEGD` for examples), as well as examples to get started with. 

### PCB Design Files

This repository is only for the library. If you want to check out the board's PCB files as well as some documentation, they can be found at [https://github.com/Electro707/Basic-NodeMCUV2-Dev-Shield](https://github.com/Electro707/Basic-NodeMCUV2-Dev-Shield)
