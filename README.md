# Basic NodeMCU-V2 Development Shield Library
## By Electro707

This library is for the Basic NodeMCU-V2 Development Shield, which is a daughterboard to be used with the NodeMCU V2 board. 
This library provides pin definitions for the board (so `SHIELD_SEGD` for examples), as well as examples to get started with. 

### PCB Design Files

This repository is only for the library. If you want to check out the board's PCB files as well as the board's documentation, they can be found at [https://github.com/Electro707/Basic-NodeMCUV2-Dev-Shield](https://github.com/Electro707/Basic-NodeMCUV2-Dev-Shield)
